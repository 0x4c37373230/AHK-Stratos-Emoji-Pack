# AHK-Stratos-Emoji-Pack
An AutoHotkey script to automatically replace [emote name]MC with the unicode character assigned to the emote. You can directly download the .ahk file and if you have AutoHotkey installed, execute it; or download the standalone executable and run that one. You can move it to `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` for it to start automatically.
